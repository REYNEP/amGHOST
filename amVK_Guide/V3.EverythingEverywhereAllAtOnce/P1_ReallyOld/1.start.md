#### Many Vulkan structures include two common fields: `.sType` and `.pNext`.
  1. `.sType`:- is an enumeration defining the type of the structure. It may seem somewhat redundant, but this information can be useful for the loader, layers, and implementations to know what type of structure was passed in through `.pNext`.
  2. `.pNext`:-llows to create a linked list between structures. It is mostly used when dealing with extensions that expose new structures to provide additional information to the loader, layers, and implementations, which can use the `.sType` field to know the type of the elements in the linked list.
