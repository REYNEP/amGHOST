## Chapter 5: `RenderPass` 🥪

> "**_`subpasses` are the soul of RenderPass!_** . But it's not just about `subpasses` only...." - ChatGPT

#### 0. Why `RenderPass`?
- _"This is one of the most convoluted parts of the Vulkan specification, especially for those who are just starting out."_ - P.A. Minerva
- ex. 1:- `PostProcessing Effects`
    ```cpp
    RenderPass:
    - color attachment
    - depth attachment

    subpasses:
    - Subpass 0: render geometry
    - Subpass 1: post-process effects
        // multiple rendering steps without switching FrameBuffers/AttachMents

    // All defined in ONE render pass
    ``` 
</br>

- ex. 2:- `Deferred Shading`
    ```cpp
    attachments:
    - position: offscreen image
    - normal: offscreen image
    - albedo: offscreen image
    - depth: depth image
    - finalColor: swapchain image
    subpasses:
    - Subpass 0: G-buffer generation (write position, normal, albedo)
    - Subpass 1: Lighting pass (read G-buffers, write to finalColor)
    ```
    - Without `subpasses`, you'd need to switch framebuffers (expensive!).
    - With `subpasses`, Vulkan can optimize this by keeping data in GPU memory (especially tile-based GPUs).
</br>

- ex. 3:- `Post-Processing Chain`
    ```cpp
    attachments:
    - scene: offscreen image
    - postProcessOut: swapchain image
    subpasses:
    - Subpass 0: scene render → scene
    - Subpass 1: post-process → postProcessOut
    ```
    - Purpose:- After rendering the main scene, do effects like bloom, blur, or color correction.
    - Why a RenderPass?
        - Again, Vulkan sees the full plan and can optimize the transitions.
        - You can define layout transitions (e.g. `COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL → SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL`)
</br>

- ex. 4:- `Shadow Map Pass` / Render from light's POV, to a depth-only image
    ```cpp
    attachments:
    - depth: depth image
    subpasses:
    - Subpass 0: write to depth only (no color)
    ```
    - Why a RenderPass?
        - This pass is often done offscreen, then used as a texture later.
</br>

- ex. 5:- `3D Scene -> Depth Testing`
    ```cpp
    attachments:
    - color: swapchain image
    - depth: depth image
    subpasses:
    - Subpass 0:
        - color attachment: color
        - depth attachment: depth
    ```
</br>






















#### 1. What is `RenderPass`? 
1. ##### `RenderPass` is designed around `subpasses`. The core purpose of a `RenderPass` is to tell Vulkan:
    > _“Hey, I’m going to do these **rendering stages** (`subpasses`), in this order, using these **attachments**.”_
    - So yeah, `subpasses` are the main reason for a RenderPass to exist, **_subpasses are the soul of RenderPass!_** But it's not just about `subpasses` only:-
        1. 🌟 `Load/Store Ops` — "What should I do with the image before & after rendering?" 
            - 🚪 loadOp — When RenderPass begins:
                ```cpp
                     LOAD: Keep whatever was already in the attachment.
                    CLEAR: Wipe it to a specific value (e.g., clear color to black).
                DONT_CARE: Vulkan can throw away old contents (faster, if you don’t care).
                ```
            - 🚪 storeOp — When RenderPass ends:
                ```cpp 
                    STORE: Save the result (e.g., to present to the screen or use later).
                DONT_CARE: Vulkan can discard the result (like shadow maps or intermediate stuff you don't need to read later).
                ```
            - ex.
            ```cpp
            colorAttachment.loadOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_CLEAR;
            colorAttachment.storeOp = VK_ATTACHMENT_STORE_OP_STORE;
                // Meaning: Clear the image before rendering, and store the result so we can present it.
            ```
        
        2. 🎯 `Image Layout Transitions` — "How should the GPU access this image during the pass?"
            ```ruby
                                    [ VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_UNDEFINED ]
                                                👇 clear
                                    [ VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL ]
                                                👇 render
                                    [ VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL ]
                                                👇 post-process
                                    [ VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR ]
            ``` 
        3. 📦 `Attachments` — "What images are we using?"
</br>

2. ##### 🎯 `Image Layout Transitions`
    1. 🏭 1. Different hardware units = different memory access patterns
        ```cpp
        GPU Unit	                Access Pattern
        ------------------     -----------------------
        Fragment Shader 	    Texture-like (random)
        Render Output Unit	    Tiled or linear (write-heavy)
        Compute Shader	        Raw buffer-style
        Display Engine	        Linear format

        - for ex.
        ```
        - When an image is used as a _**color attachment**_, it might be _stored tiled in memory_ for _fast write performance_.
        - But when you use the same image as a texture, the shader expects it to be in a format optimized for random read access.
        - 👉 If you tried to read from a tiled format as if it were a texture, you'd either:
            - Get `garbage`
            - Or pay a `huge perf penalty` as the driver does conversion.... (every single time you access a single pixel) (a single pixel would = an element in an 2D Array) (Texture might have Millions of Pixel)
    </br>

    2. 🧱 Physical Layout in VRAM (Tiles vs Linear)
        - Most modern GPUs store **_image data_** in _**tiles**_ internally.
            - (like Z-order, Morton order, or other optimized memory layouts).
            - This helps GPUs fetch memory in cache-friendly blocks for faster rendering.
        - But when an image is to be presented to the _**screen/monitor**_, it must be _**Flat (linear)**_ (as HDMI/display engines can’t decode tiles).
            - Yes — by "linear", we mean a simple 2D array where pixels are stored in a straightforward, left-to-right, top-to-bottom format.
        - So when you do this:-
            ```cpp
            finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_PRESENT_SRC_KHR;
            ```
            - 💡 What you're really telling Vulkan is:
            - > _“Yo, I’m done rendering — please un-tile this, decompress it, and arrange it in scanlines for display.”_
            - If you don’t tell Vulkan, it has to guess or stall — or worse, copy the whole thing behind your back.

    3. 🔄 Transitions let the driver do reordering, compression, or memory reallocation
        ```cpp
            //  When you declare:-
        finalLayout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL;
            // you are not just giving a hint.... 
            // ---- you are saying:-
        ```
        - > _“After rendering, I'm going to sample this as a texture — so prepare it.”_
        ```cpp
        This allows the GPU driver to:
        - flush caches
        - Decompress the image (some GPUs compress attachments during render!)
        - Move memory or restructure tiles
        - Or even alias memory with another attachment in a single memory block
        - In modern GPUs, there's hardware image compression, like:-
            - ARM's AFBC (Arm Frame Buffer Compression)
            - AMD's DCC (Delta Color Compression)
            - NVIDIA has their own secret sauce too
        ```
    
    4. 🌀 Aliasing & Tile Memory Reuse [`ImageLayouts + Barriers`]
        - One of the sickest optimizations is this one
        - You can use the same memory for multiple attachments (e.g. shadow map, depth, HDR buffer), as long as you don’t use them at the same time.
        - But to do that safely, Vulkan needs to know:
            - > _“When does this memory stop being ‘render target’ and start being ‘texture’ or ‘compute input’?”_
        ```cpp
        Layouts + barriers = safe aliasing.

        Drivers can now:
        - Use the same memory pool
        - Skip clearing
        - Not double allocate

        You become a GPU memory ninja 💨🗡️
        ```
        -  
    5. 📦 Predictability = Performance
        ```cpp
        Explicit layouts give Vulkan this power:
        - It knows exactly when and how you are going to use an image.
        - So it can avoid runtime guessing, which causes:
            - CPU stalls
            - Cache flushes
            - Sync fences
            - Or even full GPU pipeline bubbles 😵‍💫

        - Compared to OpenGL or DirectX11, where the driver had to guess what you meant and do hidden magic — Vulkan is like: 
        ```
        - > _“If you don’t tell me what layout you want, I’ll trip and fall flat on my face 😭”_

    </br>

    6. 👻 You can skip transitions altogether if you do it right
        - This is the reward -> If your RenderPass is smart — using `VK_ATTACHMENT_LOAD_OP_DONT_CARE` and reusing image layouts cleverly — you can avoid layout transitions entirely.
            - This is massive for tile-based GPUs (like on mobile phones):
            - No layout transition = no VRAM flush
            - Everything happens on-chip, like magic 💨

    7. 🎮 Analogy: Baking Cookies 🍪
        ```cpp
        Let’s say you're:
        - Baking cookies (rendering)
        - Then you plate them for display (presenting)
        - Later you want to show them off or decorate them (sample in shaders)
        ```
        - Here’s the deal:
        ```cpp
        Vulkan Image Layout	                  Cookie Stage
        ------------------------      ---------------------------------
        UNDEFINED	                    Empty tray, nothing on it yet
        COLOR_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL	    You're baking the cookies 🔥
        SHADER_READ_ONLY_OPTIMAL	    You’ve finished baking and wanna decorate (like sampling in a post-process shader) 🎨
        PRESENT_SRC_KHR	                You’re plating the cookies to serve 🥂 (sending to the screen)
        ```
        - But… here's the twist:
            - 💥 You can’t decorate cookies while they’re still baking in the oven.
            - 💥 And you definitely can’t serve someone cookies that are still stuck in a 200°C tray.
        - So Vulkan says:
            - > _“Please transition between layouts, so I know what stage your cookie is in — and I’ll move it to the right place, with oven mitts, spatulas, etc.”_

    8.  🧼 Why does this matter?
        - If you don’t do the transitions:
        ```cpp
        You may try to grab a cookie off a 200°C tray and get burned (💀 invalid reads)
        The cookies may not be fully baked (💀 undefined writes)
        Or worse: you show your customer an empty plate because Vulkan never moved them to the PRESENT_SRC_KHR plate 😭
        ```
    9.  🚀 What makes Vulkan powerful?
        ```cpp
        You get to say:
        1. "Bake in tray A"
        2. "Decorate using buffer B"
        3. "Present from plate C"

        But you must tell Vulkan when to move cookies from one surface to another.
        Layouts = telling Vulkan exactly thaaat!
        ```

    10. 🧪 Subpass Optimization (Tile-Based GPUs)
        ```cpp
        On tile-based GPUs (like PowerVR or Mali):
        - Entire framebuffers live on-chip, in tiles
        - You can run all subpasses without touching VRAM!

        But it only works if Vulkan knows:
        - The image will stay in the same layout
        - No unnecessary STORE or layout transitions

        By carefully using:
            layout = VK_IMAGE_LAYOUT_ATTACHMENT_OPTIMAL;
            loadOp = DONT_CARE;
            storeOp = DONT_CARE;

        You unlock 🥷 zero-cost rendering.
        ```
        - That's why subpasses and layouts are so closely linked — **_no layout change_** → **_no memory movement._**
</br>

3. ##### 🏁 TL;DR: Layout Transitions Aren’t Just Bureaucracy
    ```cpp
    They are literal instructions to the driver:
        - "Where this image lives"
        - "How it’s structured"
        - "What GPU unit will touch it next"
        - "Whether you need to prepare, flush, decompress, or alias it"

    And by explicitly telling the GPU, you:
        - Avoid expensive guesses
        - Skip hidden memory ops
        - Unlock mobile-level optimizations
        - Prevent subtle bugs and undefined behavior
    ``` 

4. ##### 📦 `Attachments`
- Attachments are simply images (or buffers) where Vulkan stores or reads data during a RenderPass.
- Attachments are the actual framebuffer images (swapchain images, depth buffers, offscreen render targets, etc.)
</br>

1. 🖌️ Color Attachments = where the pretty pixels (RGBA) are painted and stored. This is like your paint palette! 🎨
2. 🏔️ Depth Attachments = the landscapes that prevent objects from clipping or showing up out of order. Imagine topography maps for depth! 🗺️
3. ✏️ Stencil Attachments = the guides that show where we can paint, like drawing a "map" where only certain areas can be modified. 🗺️
</br>

- What’s inside?
    - A framebuffer that stores things like RGBA values (Red, Green, Blue, Alpha/Transparency).
    - For example, 
        - Color Attachment 0 might hold the albedo or the final color of an object, while 
        - Color Attachment 1 could store the lighting information or additional passes like ambient occlusion.
```cpp
Each attachment you declare includes:
- Format (VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_SRGB, etc.)
- Sample count (for MSAA)
- Load/store ops
- Layouts (see above)
```
- Then, each subpass tells Vulkan:
- > _"From all the attachments I’ve declared, I’m gonna use these ones in this subpass."_
- in Code:
```cpp
attachments[0] = colorAttachment;   // swapchain image
attachments[1] = depthAttachment;   // depth image

subpass.colorAttachment = &attachments[0];
subpass.depthAttachment = &attachments[1];
```
```cpp
So even if your RenderPass only has one subpass, the Vulkan driver still wants to know:
- How many attachments
- What to do with them (clear/store?)
- What layouts they go into and come out as
```


5. ##### `FrameBuffers`
- binds concrete image views (e.g., swapchain images, depth textures) to the attachments defined in the RenderPass.
- Must match the RenderPass’s attachment specifications (format, size, sample count).
- Is swapchain-dependent (e.g., each swapchain image typically has its own Framebuffer).
- Analogy
    - RenderPass = A recipe requiring "2 eggs and 1 cup of flour" (attachments).
    - Framebuffer = The actual eggs and flour (image views) you use to bake a cake (render a frame).

| UINT          | Unsigned Integer     | [0, 255] (as uint)            | Integer render targets (e.g., stencil IDs, voxel data).  |
| SINT          | Signed Integer       | [-128, 127] (as int)          | Signed integer data (e.g., compute shader outputs).      |
| SRGB          | sRGB Gamma-Corrected | [0.0, 1.0] (sRGB → Linear)   | Textures/swapchain images (proper color blending).       |
