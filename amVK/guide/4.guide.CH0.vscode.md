1. Choose between a) `vscode` b) `visual studio`
    1. `vscode`:- _**lightweight**_, (i'd say _faster_ & _simpler_), 
        1. _You can do basically anything, thanks to extensions_
    2. `visual studio`:- big, doesn't look cool, strong, nice debugger, (but lacks good extensions)
        1. _only good for big projects_
        2. i wouldn't use before my project has hundreds of files
    3. `c++ compiler`:-
        1. Linux:- GNU C / C++ Compilers
        2. Mac:- Clang / LLVM
        3. Intel:- Intel C++ Compiler
        4. IBM:- IBM C++ Compiler
        5. Texas Instruments:- Their own C++ Compiler duuh ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
            - They make calculators haha
        6. Windows:- Microsoft Visual C++ compiler/package
            - comes with two thingies
            - `visual studio`
            - `visual studio buiild tools`
            - both are separate & can co-exist in a windows/OS/system
            - `vscode` can use either of those two.
            - `vscode` can even use `msys64 mingw-w64`
        7. On windows, you don't _**"Have To"**_ grab `visual studio` / `build tools`
            - there is one other way
            - i.e.
            - `msys64 mingw-w64`
            - https://www.msys2.org/
        8. if you plan to have both `vscode` & `visual studio`
            - you wouldn't need to install `visual studio build tools` separately
            - instead while installing `visual studio` grab `C++ Development` + `Windows SDK`  ~

3. Grabbing `visual studio`
    1. https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/ 
    2. you will see `visual studio` @ the top part of the webpage
    3. choose `C++ Development`, `Windows SDK` when installing
        1. this will install the `C++ Compiler & Stuffs`, windows people calls it `Microsoft Visual C++ compiler/package`
        2. you don't need `visual studio build tools` simultanously along with it
 </br></br>

2. Grabbing `vscode`
    1. https://code.visualstudio.com/download
    2. now we need `C++ Compiler`
        1. `option-1`:- grab the `build tools` from the end of this page
            - https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools
        2. `option-2`:- the msys64 --> mingw-w64 [package]
            - it contains the [gnu] c++ compiler, built for windows üòÑ
            - https://www.msys2.org/
        3. `option-3`:- grabbing `visual studio` with `C++ Dev` + `Windows SDK` 
    3. now we need some `vscode extensions` üòÉ
        1. _i.e. extra features made by the community_
            - remember:- these features can be really really powerfull üòâ
        2. extension [ms-vscode.cmake-tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools)
        3. extension [twxs.cmake](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=twxs.cmake)
        4. extension [ms-vscode.cpptools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools)
        5. restart VSCode
