     * called by process_events() -> ::DispatchMessageA()
     * 
     * win32 "Window Procedure Function" [WndProc] - Deals with OS Messages and Events, hwnd is the Handle to Window
     * 
     * Windows asks for this function to be a GLOBAL STATIC function. But why would this work while being defined inside a Class?
     * WHY-THIS-WORKS:-
     *   C++ treats MEMBER_FUNCs and free functions [i.e. PUBLIC_STATIC_FUNCs] differently 
     *              MEMBER_FUNCs need to have access to a "this" pointer, and typically that's passed in as a hidden first parameter to MEMBER_FUNCs
     *   You can, however, declare "WndProc" as a PUBLIC_STATIC_FUNC, which eliminates the this pointer. [https://stackoverflow.com/a/17221900]
     * 
     * EASTER:- Let's See if anyone can use the Power of this being Public, 
     *          [I mean you could just call amGHOST_SystemWIN32::WndProc() & pass in aruments to it, MANUALLY CREATING "EVENTS"]
     *           That's It POWERRRRRR
